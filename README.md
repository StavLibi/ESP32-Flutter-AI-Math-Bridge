# ESP32-Flutter-AI-Math-Bridge
 A Flutter-based mobile app that communicates with an external ESP32 device over Bluetooth. The app receives math computation requests from the ESP32, processes them locally or via OpenAI's API when needed, and sends the results back â€” enabling advanced offloading of mathematical tasks from the microcontroller to a smart AI-powered bridge.
